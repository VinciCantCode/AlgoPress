# 48. Rotate Image
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1
> Input: matrix = `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`
>
> Output: `[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]`

Example 2
> Input: matrix = `[[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]`
>
> Output: `[[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]`

Constraints
- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`

## How to solve the problem

- Matrix Transpose + Row Reversal

**Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        Rotates the given n x n matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
        """
        n = len(matrix)

        # Step 1: Transpose the matrix (swap matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i])
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

        # Step 2: Reverse each row to complete the 90-degree rotation
        for row in matrix:
            row.reverse()
```

## Complexity

- **Approach**: Matrix Transpose + Row Reversal

- Time complexity: O(n²)
  - We need to traverse the entire matrix, which has n² elements

- Space complexity: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space, modifying the matrix in-place
