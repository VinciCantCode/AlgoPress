# 238. Product of Array Except Self
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1
> Input: nums = `[1,2,3,4]`
>
> Output: `[24,12,8,6]`

Example 2
> Input: nums = `[-1,1,0,-3,3]`
>
> Output: `[0,0,9,0,0]`

Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## How to solve the problem

- Two-Pass Array Traversal

**Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [1] * n  # Output array, initialized with 1s

        # First pass: accumulate product of all elements to the left of each index
        left = 1
        for i in range(n):
            res[i] = left       # At index i, res[i] is the product of all elements to the left
            left *= nums[i]     # Update left with current element for next iteration

        # Second pass: accumulate product of all elements to the right of each index
        right = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] *= right     # Multiply with the product of all elements to the right
            right *= nums[i]    # Update right with current element for next iteration

        return res
```

## Complexity

- **Approach 1**: Two-Pass Array Traversal

- Time complexity: O(n)
  - We traverse the array twice, each pass takes O(n) time

- Space complexity: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space (excluding the output array)
  - The output array is not counted as extra space as per problem requirements
