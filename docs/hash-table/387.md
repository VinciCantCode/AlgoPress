# 387. First Unique Character in a String
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

Example 1
> Input: s = `"leetcode"`
>
> Output: `0`
>
> Explanation: The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

Example 2
> Input: s = `"loveleetcode"`
>
> Output: `2`

Example 3
> Input: s = `"aabb"`
>
> Output: `-1`

Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## How to solve the problem

- Hash Table with Character Counting

**Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        myHash = {}
        for c in s:
            myHash[c] = myHash.get(c, 0) + 1
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if myHash[c] == 1:
                return i
        return -1
```

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        myHash = Counter(s)
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if myHash[c] == 1:
                return i
        return -1
```

## Complexity

- **Approach 1**: Hash Table with Character Counting

- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(1) We only store character counts, which is bounded by the size of the alphabet (26 for lowercase English letters).
