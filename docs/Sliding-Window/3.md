# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

Example 1
> Input: s = "abcabcbb"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2
> Input: s = "bbbbb"
>
> Output: 1
>
> Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3
> Input: s = "pwwkew"
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## How to solve the problem

- Approach: Sliding Window

**Code**

- Hash Map

```Python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        left = 0
        count = Counter()  # hashmap k: char value: int
        ans = 0
        for right, x in enumerate(s):
            count[x] += 1
            while count[x] > 1:
                count[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
        return ans        
```

- Hash Set

```Python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        left = 0
        seen = set() # hash set, no need to record counter times. We only care this character is duplicated or not
        ans = 0
        for right, x in enumerate(s):
            while x in seen:
                seen.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            seen.add(x)
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
        return ans
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1) The length of the longest string is 128(ASCII).
