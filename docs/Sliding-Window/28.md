# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/ "Let's go to leetcode")

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

Example 1:
> Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
> The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:
> Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
> Output: -1
> Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## How to solve the problem

- Use a sliding window approach to check each possible starting position in `haystack`.
- For each position, compare the substring with `needle` character by character.
- Return the first position where a match is found, or -1 if no match exists.

**Code**

- Approach 1: Character-by-Character Comparison

```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            for j in range(len(needle)):
                if haystack[i + j] != needle[j]:
                    break
            else:
                return i
        return -1
```

- Approach 2: String Slicing

```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        for i in range(len(haystack) -  len(needle) + 1):
            if haystack[i:len(needle) + i] == needle:
                return i
        return - 1
```

## Complexity

- **Approach 1(Character-by-Character Comparison)**

- Time complexity: O(n*m): 
For each position in `haystack` (O(n)), we compare with `needle` character by character (O(m)), so in total is O(n*m).

- Space complexity: O(1): 
We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

- **Approach 2(String Slicing)**

- Time complexity: O(n*m):
For each position in `haystack` (O(n)), we create a substring slice and compare with `needle` (O(m)), so in total is O(n*m).

- Space complexity: O(m):
We create a substring slice of length `m` for each comparison.
