# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1
> Input: prices = [`7,1,5,3,6,4`]
>
> Output: `7`
>
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
> Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
> Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Example 2
> Input: prices = [`1,2,3,4,5`]
>
> Output: `4`
>
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
> Total profit is 4.

Example 3
> Input: prices = [`7,6,4,3,1`]
>
> Output: `0`
>
> Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

Constraints
- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## How to solve the problem

- Recursion with Memoization

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)

        @cache  # Memoization to avoid recalculating the same states
        def dfs(i, hold):
            if i < 0:
                # If no stock is held, profit is 0
                # If stock is held before day 0, it's invalid â†’ return negative infinity
                return -inf if hold else 0

            if hold:
                # Two choices:
                # 1. Keep holding the stock
                # 2. Buy today (which means we were not holding yesterday)
                return max(dfs(i - 1, True), dfs(i - 1, False) - prices[i])
            else:
                # Two choices:
                # 1. Keep not holding the stock
                # 2. Sell today (which means we were holding yesterday)
                return max(dfs(i - 1, False), dfs(i - 1, True) + prices[i])

        # Start from the last day, with no stock held
        return dfs(n - 1, False)
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) 
- Space complexity: O(n)
