# 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-good-strings/)

Given the integers `zero`, `one`, `low`, and `high`, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

- Append the character '0' `zero` times.
- Append the character '1' `one` times.

This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1
> Input: low = `3`, high = `3`, zero = `1`, one = `1`
>
> Output: `8`
>
> Explanation: 
> One possible valid good string is "011". 
> It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011". 
> All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.

Example 2
> Input: low = `2`, high = `3`, zero = `1`, one = `2`
>
> Output: `5`
>
> Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".

Constraints
- `1 <= low <= high <= 10^5`
- `1 <= zero, one <= low`

## How to solve the problem

- Optimized Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def countGoodStrings(self, low: int, high: int, zero: int, one: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        f = [0] * (high + 1)
        f[0] = 1
        result = 0
        for i in range(1, high + 1):
            if i - zero >= 0: # Can append `zero` zeros
                f[i] = (f[i] + f[i - zero]) % MOD
            if i - one >= 0: # Can append `one` ones 
                f[i] = (f[i] + f[i - one]) % MOD
        for i in range(low, high + 1):
            result = (result + f[i]) % MOD
        return result
```
