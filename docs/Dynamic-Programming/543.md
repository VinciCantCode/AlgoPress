# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1
> Input: root = `[1,2,3,4,5]`
>
> Output: `3`
>
> Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Example 2
> Input: root = `[1,2]`
>
> Output: `1`

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## How to solve the problem

- Depth-First Search (DFS)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

# The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes.
# This path may or may not pass through the root.
# For each node, the longest path that passes through it equals the sum of the depths of its left and right subtrees.
# We use DFS to compute the depth of each subtree and update the maximum diameter found.

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        result = -inf

        def dfs(node):
            if node is None:
                return -1
            l_len = dfs(node.left) + 1  # Length of left subtree
            r_len = dfs(node.right) + 1  # Length of right subtree
            nonlocal result
            result = max(result, l_len + r_len)
            return max(l_len, r_len)

        dfs(root)
        return result  # Return the maximum diameter
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(h)
