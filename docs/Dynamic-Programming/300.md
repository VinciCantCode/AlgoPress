# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

Example 1
> Input: nums = [`10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18`]
>
> Output: `4`
>
> Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2
> Input: nums = [`0,1,0,3,2,3`]
>
> Output: `4`

Example 3
> Input: nums = [`7,7,7,7,7,7,7`]
>
> Output: `1`

Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## How to solve the problem

- Binary Search with Greedy

```python
# Approach 1: Binary Search with Greedy
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        g = []  # g[i]: the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of length i+1
        for x in nums:
            j = bisect_left(g, x)  # find insertion point for x to keep g sorted
            if j == len(g):
                g.append(x)  # extend the sequence
            else:
                g[j] = x  # replace to maintain the smallest possible tail
        return len(g)  # length of LIS
        
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n * log n) 
- Space complexity: O(n)
