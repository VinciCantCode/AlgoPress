# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
<Badge type="danger" text="Hard" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1
> Input: k = `2`, prices = [`2,4,1`]
>
> Output: `2`
>
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

Example 2
> Input: k = `2`, prices = [`3,2,6,5,0,3`]
>
> Output: `7`
>
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

Constraints
- `1 <= k <= 100`
- `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

## How to solve the problem

- Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        # f[j][0]: max profit after j transactions, no stock
        # f[j][1]: max profit after j transactions, holding stock
        f = [[-inf] * 2 for _ in range(k + 2)]
        for j in range(1, k + 2):
            f[j][0] = 0  # base case: no stock, 0 profit

        for i, p in enumerate(prices):
            for j in range(k + 1, 0, -1):
                f[j][0] = max(f[j][0], f[j - 1][1] + p)  # sell
                f[j][1] = max(f[j][1], f[j][0] - p)  # buy

        return f[k + 1][0]  # final answer
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n * k) 
- Space complexity: O(k)
