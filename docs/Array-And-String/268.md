# 268. Missing Number
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1
> Input: nums = `[3,0,1]`
>
> Output: `2`
>
> Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2
> Input: nums = `[0,1]`
>
> Output: `2`
>
> Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3
> Input: nums = `[9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]`
>
> Output: `8`
>
> Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers of `nums` are unique.

## How to solve the problem

- Mathematical Approach (Sum)
- Bit Manipulation (XOR)

**Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        actual_sum = sum(nums)
        return expected_sum - actual_sum
```

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        missing = len(nums)
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            missing ^= i ^ num
        return missing
```

## Complexity

- **Approach 1**: Mathematical Approach (Sum)

- Time complexity: O(n)
  - We need to calculate the sum of the array, which takes O(n) time

- Space complexity: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space

- **Approach 2**: Bit Manipulation (XOR)

- Time complexity: O(n)
  - We traverse the array once, which takes O(n) time

- Space complexity: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space
