# 165. Compare Version Numbers
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/)

Given two version strings, `version1` and `version2`, compare them. A version string consists of revisions separated by dots `'.'`. The value of the revision is its integer conversion ignoring leading zeros.

To compare version strings, compare their revision values in left-to-right order. If one of the version strings has fewer revisions, treat the missing revision values as `0`.

Return the following:
- If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
- If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
- Otherwise, return `0`.

Example 1
> Input: version1 = `"1.2"`, version2 = `"1.10"`
>
> Output: `-1`
>
> Explanation: version1's second revision is "2" and version2's second revision is "10": 2 < 10, so version1 < version2.

Example 2
> Input: version1 = `"1.01"`, version2 = `"1.001"`
>
> Output: `0`
>
> Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both "01" and "001" represent the same integer "1".

Example 3
> Input: version1 = `"1.0"`, version2 = `"1.0.0.0"`
>
> Output: `0`
>
> Explanation: version1 has less revisions, which means every missing revision are treated as "0".

Constraints
- `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
- `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
- `version1` and `version2` are valid version numbers.
- All the given revisions in `version1` and `version2` can be stored in a 32-bit integer.

## How to solve the problem

- Split and Compare Approach
- Two Pointers Approach

**Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        num1 = [int(x) for x in version1.split('.')]
        num2 = [int(x) for x in version2.split('.')]

        l1 = len(num1)
        l2 = len(num2)
        for i in range(max(l1,l2)):
            if i < l1:
                n1 = num1[i]
            else: n1 = 0
            if i < l2:
                n2 = num2[i]
            else: n2 = 0
            if n1 != n2:
                if n1 > n2:
                    return 1
                else: return -1
        return 0
```

```python
class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        num1 = [int(x) for x in version1.split('.')]
        num2 = [int(x) for x in version2.split('.')]

        l1 = len(num1)
        l2 = len(num2)
        for i in range(max(l1,l2)):
            n1 = num1[i] if i < l1 else 0
            n2 = num2[i] if i < l2 else 0
            if n1 != n2:
                if n1 > n2:
                    return 1
                else: return -1
        return 0
```

## Complexity

- **Approach**: Split and Compare Approach

- Time complexity: O(n + m)
  - Where n and m are the lengths of version1 and version2. We need to split both strings, convert substrings to integers, and compare at most max(revisions1, revisions2) pairs.

- Space complexity: O(n + m)
  - We store the split versions in arrays, where the space is proportional to the number of revisions in each version string.
