# 206. Reverse Linked List
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1
> Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
>
> Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2
> Input: head = [1,2]
>
> Output: [2,1]

Example 3
> Input: head = []
>
> Output: []

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5000]
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## How to solve the problem

**Code**

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        pre = None
        cur = head
        while cur:
            nxt = cur.next
            cur.next = pre
            pre = cur
            cur = nxt
        return pre
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
