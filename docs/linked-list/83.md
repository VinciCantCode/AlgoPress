# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
<Badge type="tip" text="Eazy" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1
> Input: head = [1,1,2]
>
> Output: [1,2]

Example 2
> Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
>
> Output: [1,2,3]

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300]
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order

## How to solve the problem

**Code**

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        cur = head
        if cur is None:
            return head
        while cur.next: # when the last node is not None
            if cur.val == cur.next.val:
                cur.next = cur.next.next
            else:
                cur = cur.next # cur++
        return head
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
