# 1534. Count Good Triplets

Given an array of integers arr, and three integers a, b and c. You need to find the number of good triplets.

A triplet (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]) is good if the following conditions are true:

0 <= i < j < k < arr.length

|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a

|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b

|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c  
Where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.

Return the number of good triplets.

> Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,0,1,1,9,7], a = 7, b = 2, c = 3

Output: 4

Explanation: There are 4 good triplets: [(3,0,1), (3,0,1), (3,1,1), (0,1,1)].

> Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,3], a = 0, b = 0, c = 1

Output: 0

Explanation: No triplet satisfies all conditions.
 
Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 100

0 <= arr[i] <= 1000

0 <= a, b, c <= 1000

## How to solve the problem

- Adding the first if statement `if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a: ` before the innermost loop, we can skip the entire innermost loop if the first condition is not satisfied.

- Using `and` for logic connection instead of bitwise AND `&` in Python.

- If a method is in class, we need the first parameter `self` to call the instance of class. And also we need an instance to call the method. Otherwise, using `@staticmethod` ouside class.


**Code**

```Python
class Solution:
    def countGodTriplets(arr: list[int], a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(arr)):
                for j in range(i + 1 ,len(arr)):
                    if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a:
                        for k in range(j + 1, len(arr)):
                            if abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b and  abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c:
                                count += 1
        return count
```

## Complexity

Time complexity: O(n^3)

Weâ€™re using 3 nested loops to go through every possible triplet.

Space complexity: O(1)

Only using one counter for the result.
