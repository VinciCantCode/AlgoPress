# 100. Same Tree
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" /> [<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1
> ![100. Same Tree](../images/100.jpg)
>
> Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
>
> Output: true

Example 2
> Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
>
> Output: false

Example 3
> Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
>
> Output: false

Constraints
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100]
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104


## How to solve the problem

**Code**

- Recursion
```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p is None or q is None:
            return p is q
        # current node equal or not; left node equal or not; right node equal or not
        return p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), n == number of nodes
- Space complexity: O(n)
