# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" /> [<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

## Example 1
> ![222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](../images/222.jpg)
>
> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>
> Output: 6

## Example 2
> Input: root = []
>
> Output: 0

## Example 3
> Input: root = [1]
>
> Output: 1

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4
- The tree is guaranteed to be complete.

## How to solve the problem

### Recursion (DFS)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def dfs(node):
            if node is None:
                return 0
            num_left = dfs(node.left)
            num_right = dfs(node.right)
            return num_left + num_right + 1

        return dfs(root)
```
- More simplified code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        return self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right) + 1
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), n == number of nodes
- Space complexity: O(n)
