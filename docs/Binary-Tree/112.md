# 112. Path Sum
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" /> [<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1
> ![112. Path Sum](../images/112.jpg)
>
> Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

Example 2
> Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
> (1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
> (1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
> There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

Example 3
> Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000]
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
- -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000


## How to solve the problem

**Code**

- Recursion (DFS)
```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        def dfs(node, current_sum):
            if not node:
                return False
            current_sum += node.val
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return current_sum == targetSum
            return dfs(node.left, current_sum) or dfs(node.right, current_sum)

        return dfs(root, 0)
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), n == number of nodes
- Space complexity: O(n)
