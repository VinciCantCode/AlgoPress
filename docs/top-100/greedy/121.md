# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" /> [<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
> **Output:** `5`  
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`  
> **Output:** `0`  
> **Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`


## How to solve the problem

- Brute Force O(n^2)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for buy in range(len(prices)):
            for sell in range(buy+1,len(prices)):
                if prices[sell] > prices[buy]:
                    profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy]
                    result = max(result, profit)
        return result
```
- Greedy

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = inf
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < min_price:
                min_price = prices[i]
            profit = prices[i] - min_price
            result = max(profit,result)
        return result
```
## Complexity
- **Brute Force**: Time complexity: `O(n^2)`, Space complexity: `O(1)` - Where `n` is the length of the prices array. We check all possible buy-sell pairs.
- **Greedy**: Time complexity: `O(n)`, Space complexity: `O(1)` - We traverse the array once and use constant extra space.
