# 45. Jump Game II

<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" /> [<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

You are given a `0`-indexed array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at index `0`. Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at index `i`, you can jump to any index `(i + j)` where: `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and `i + j < n`. Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index `n - 1`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index `n - 1`.

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`  
> **Output:** `2`  
> **Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** `nums = [2,3,0,1,4]`  
> **Output:** `2`  
> **Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.


## How to solve the problem

- Greedy

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0
        end = 0  # current jump boundary
        far = 0  # farthest index we can reach
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            far = max(far, i+nums[i])
            if i == end:  # end of current jump, need one more jump
                result += 1
                end = far
                if end >= len(nums) - 1:
                    return result
        return result
```
## Complexity
- **Greedy**: Time complexity: `O(n)`, Space complexity: `O(1)` - Where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once and use constant extra space.
