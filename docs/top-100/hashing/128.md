# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 

Example 1
> Input: nums = `[100,4,200,1,3,2]`
> Output: `4`
> Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is `4`.

Example 2
> Input: nums = `[0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`
> Output: `9`

Example 3
> Input: nums = `[1,0,1,2]`
> Output: `3`
 

Constraints
- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`


## How to solve the problem

- Sorting

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        nums = sorted(set(nums))
        current_len = 1
        max_len = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1:
                current_len += 1
                max_len = max(current_len, max_len)
            else: 
                current_len = 1
        return max_len
```
- Hashing

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        length = 0
        max_length = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 not in nums:
                length = 1
                while num + length in nums:
                    length += 1
                max_length = max(length, max_length)
        return max_length
```
## Complexity
- **Sorting**: Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(1)
- **Hashing**: Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)
  - Each element is visited at most twice (once in the outer loop, once in the inner while loop)
