# 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in `s`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1
> Input: s = `"bbbab"`
>
> Output: `4`
>
> Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Example 2
> Input: s = `"cbbd"`
>
> Output: `2`
>
> Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## How to solve the problem

- Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)

        @cache
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i > j:
                return 0  # empty substring
            if i == j:
                return 1  # single character
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                return dfs(i + 1, j - 1) + 2  # match: extend by 2
            return max(dfs(i + 1, j), dfs(i, j - 1))  # skip left or right

        return dfs(0, n - 1)
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2) 
- Space complexity: O(n^2)
