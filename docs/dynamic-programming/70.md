# 70. Climbing Stairs
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1
> Input: n = `2`
>
> Output: `2`
>
> Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
> 1. 1 step + 1 step
> 2. 2 steps

Example 2
> Input: n = `3`
>
> Output: `3`
>
> Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
> 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
> 2. 1 step + 2 steps
> 3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 45`

## How to solve the problem

- Recursion with Memoization

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        @cache
        def dfs(i):
            if i <= 1:
                return 1
            return dfs(i - 1) + dfs(i - 2)

        return dfs(n)
```

- Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:

        f = [0] * (n + 2)
        f[0] = f[1] = 1
        for i in range(n):
            f[i + 2] = f[i + 1] + f[i]
        return f[n]

```
- Optimized Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        f0 = f1 = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            f = f0 + f1
            f0 = f1
            f1 = f
        return f1
```

## Complexity
- **Approach 1 (Recursion with Memoization)**: Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)
- **Approach 2 (Dynamic Programming)**: Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)
- **Approach 3 (Optimized DP)**: Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)
