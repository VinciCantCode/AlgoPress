# 72. Edit Distance
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

Example 1
> Input: word1 = `"horse"`, word2 = `"ros"`
>
> Output: `3`
>
> Explanation: 
> horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
> rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
> rose -> ros (remove 'e')

Example 2
> Input: word1 = `"intention"`, word2 = `"execution"`
>
> Output: `5`
>
> Explanation: 
> intention -> inention (remove 't')
> inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
> enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
> exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
> exection -> execution (insert 'u')

Constraints
- `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## How to solve the problem

- Recursion with Memoization

```python
# Approach 1: Recursion with Memoization
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        n, m = len(word1), len(word2)

        @cache  
        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> int:
            # If word1 is empty, insert all characters of word2
            if i < 0:
                return j + 1
            # If word2 is empty, delete all characters of word1
            if j < 0:
                return i + 1
            # If current characters match, move to the previous characters
            if word1[i] == word2[j]:
                return dfs(i - 1, j - 1)
            # Otherwise, try insert, delete, or replace, and take the minimum
            return min(
                dfs(i - 1, j),     # delete from word1
                dfs(i, j - 1),     # insert into word1
                dfs(i - 1, j - 1)  # replace in word1
            ) + 1

        # Start recursion from the last characters of both words
        return dfs(n - 1, m - 1)
```

## Complexity
- **Approach 1 (Recursion with Memoization)**: Time complexity: O(n * m), Space complexity: O(n * m)
