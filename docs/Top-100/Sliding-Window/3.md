# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" /> [<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** `s = "abcabcbb"`  
> **Output:** `3`  
> **Explanation:** The answer is `"abc"`, with the length of `3`.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** `s = "bbbbb"`  
> **Output:** `1`  
> **Explanation:** The answer is `"b"`, with the length of `1`.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** `s = "pwwkew"`  
> **Output:** `3`  
> **Explanation:** The answer is `"wke"`, with the length of `3`.

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


## How to solve the problem

- Sliding Window

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        left = 0
        substring = set()
        result = 0
        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in substring:
                substring.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            substring.add(s[right])
            length = right - left + 1
            result = max(length, result)
        return result     
```
## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - Each character is visited at most twice (once by right pointer, once by left pointer)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(min(m, n))` - Where `m` is the size of the character set and `n` is the length of string. The set stores at most `min(m, n)` characters
