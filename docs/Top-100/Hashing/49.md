# 49. Group Anagrams
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1
> Input: strs = `["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`
> Output: `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`
> Explanation: There is no string in `strs` that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
> The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
> The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

Example 2
> Input: strs = `[""]`
> Output: `[[""]]`

Example 3
> Input: strs = `["a"]`
> Output: `[["a"]]`

 

Constraints
- `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.


## How to solve the problem

- HashMap

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anaDict = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            key = ''.join(sorted(s))
            anaDict[key].append(s)
        return list(anaDict.values())
```
```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anaDict = {}
        for s in strs:
            key = ''.join(sorted(s))
            if key not in anaDict:
                anaDict[key] = []
            anaDict[key].append(s)
        return list(anaDict.values())
```
## Complexity
- **HashMap**: Time complexity: O(n * m * log(m)), Space complexity: O(n * m)
  - Where n is the number of strings and m is the average length of strings
  - The log(m) factor comes from sorting each string
