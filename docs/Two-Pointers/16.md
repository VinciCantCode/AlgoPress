# 16. 3Sum Closest
<Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/ "Let's go to leetcode")

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example 1:
> Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

Example 2:
> Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
> Output: 0
> Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

## Constraints:
- `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

## How to solve the problem

- Sorting the array `nums` first to use two pointer approach.
- Use three pointers: one for the first element, and two pointers for the remaining two elements.
- Keep track of the closest sum found so far and update it when a closer sum is found.

**Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        result = inf
        for k in range(2,n):
            left = 0
            right = k -1
            while left < right:
                current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right] + nums[k]
                if current_sum == target:
                    return current_sum
                if abs(current_sum - target) < abs(result - target):
                    result = current_sum
                if current_sum > target:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    left += 1
        return result 
```

## Complexity

Time complexity: O(n²)

- Traversing `nums[k]` is O(n), two pointer is O(n), so in total is O(n²).

Space complexity: O(1)

- We ignore the memory required for the output. For the purpose of complexity analysis, we also ignore sorting algorithm.
