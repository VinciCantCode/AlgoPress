# 1616. Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome
<Badge type="tip" text="Easy" />[<Badge type="info" text="LeetCode" />](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

You are given two strings a and b of the same length. Choose an index and split both strings at the same index, splitting a into two strings: aprefix and asuffix where a = aprefix + asuffix, and splitting b into two strings: bprefix and bsuffix where b = bprefix + bsuffix. Check if aprefix + bsuffix or bprefix + asuffix forms a palindrome.

When you split a string s into sprefix and ssuffix, either ssuffix or sprefix is allowed to be empty. For example, if s = "abc", then "" + "abc", "a" + "bc", "ab" + "c" , and "abc" + "" are valid splits.

Return true if it is possible to form a palindrome string, otherwise return false.

Notice that x + y denotes the concatenation of strings x and y.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = "x", b = "y"
Output: true
Explaination: If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you can split in the following way:
aprefix = "", asuffix = "x"
bprefix = "", bsuffix = "y"
Then, aprefix + bsuffix = "" + "y" = "y", which is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: a = "xbdef", b = "xecab"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: a = "ulacfd", b = "jizalu"
Output: true
Explaination: Split them at index 3:
aprefix = "ula", asuffix = "cfd"
bprefix = "jiz", bsuffix = "alu"
Then, aprefix + bsuffix = "ula" + "alu" = "ulaalu", which is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105
a.length == b.length
a and b consist of lowercase English letters

## How to solve the problem

- Brute Force(Time Limit Exceeded)

```python
class Solution:
    def checkPalindromeFormation(self, a: str, b: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(a))+1:
            s1 = a[:i] + b[i:]
            s2 = b[:i] + a[i:]
            if s1 == s1[::-1] or s2 == s2[::-1]:
                return True
        return False

```

```python
class Solution:
    def checkPalindromeFormation(self, a: str, b: str) -> bool:
        def check(a, b):
            i, j = 0, len(a) - 1
            while i < j and a[i] == b[j]:
                i += 1
                j -= 1
            return (a[i : j + 1] == a[i : j + 1][::-1] or b[i : j + 1] == b[i : j + 1][::-1])  
                # Think about this case when you need a counter-exapmle: a = "abcba" b = "axcxa"

        return check(a, b) or check(b, a)
        # Must check both check(a, b) and check(b, a)
        # check(a, b): aprefix + bsuffix
        # check(b, a): bprefix + asuffix
        # Think about this case: a = "efdef", b = "fecab"
```

- **Approach 1 (For loop)**: Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)
- **Approach 3 (Two pointers)**: Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)
